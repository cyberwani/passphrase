# PassPhrase

### Description
<p>PassPhrase is a Secure Passphrase Generator written in PHP.</p>

<p>The word "passphrase" is used to convey the idea that a password, which is a single word, is far too short to protect you and that using a longer phrase is much better.</p>

<p>Using passphrases made of randomly-chosen words can be both easy to remember and hard for someone else to guess, which is what we want out of a passphrase.</p>

<p>Using the <a href="//www.eff.org/" title="Electronic Frontier Foundation" target="_blank">EFF</a> long wordlist, we simply use PHPs <code>array_rand()</code> function to select 5 random words from the wordlist to generate a secure, random passphrase.</p>

<p>You can clone and host locally, upload and run it from your own remote server, or you can use the online version.</p>
